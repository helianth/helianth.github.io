I'm still having difficulties with making time for this course. There are plenty of excuses I could give, but I know others in similar situations (balancing work, life etc.) manage to go through the courses much more quickly. It took me four months to finally get to Object Oriented Ruby, and I wish I'd gotten there sooner since it's definitely the most absorbing coursework so far. Constructing elegant code is challenging, but definitely feels worthwhile when you've managed to condense multiple functions into one or two lines.

I'm going to try to start the CLI data gem project by the end of this week and really prioritize this course. If only I could code during my hour (sometimes hour and a half) long commutes.
